    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This assignment uses a small subset of the data from Kaggle's [Yelp Business Rating Prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/yelp-recsys-2013) competition.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Description of the data:**\n",
    "\n",
    "- `yelp.json` is the original format of the file. `yelp.csv` contains the same data, in a more convenient format. Both of the files are in this repo, so there is no need to download the data from the Kaggle website.\n",
    "- Each observation in this dataset is a review of a particular business by a particular user.\n",
    "- The \"stars\" column is the number of stars (1 through 5) assigned by the reviewer to the business. (Higher stars is better.) In other words, it is the rating of the business by the person who wrote the review.\n",
    "- The \"cool\" column is the number of \"cool\" votes this review received from other Yelp users. All reviews start with 0 \"cool\" votes, and there is no limit to how many \"cool\" votes a review can receive. In other words, it is a rating of the review itself, not a rating of the business.\n",
    "- The \"useful\" and \"funny\" columns are similar to the \"cool\" column."
